# Showcase 3: Cookie inspection

## Showcase Requirements

Before installing this showcase to the device, please install ADLINK EVASDK and set the EVA environment as necessary.

## Showcase 3 Installation

The path to the respective demo folder includes install.sh and run.sh for each showcase.

Install.sh will perform the following steps:

1. Download the demo video.
2. Download the inference ONNX model file and label file.
3. Download the required showcase demo videos and plug-in setup files.
### Make sure execute all [steps](https://github.com/IST-EVA-Support/EVA_Show-Case/tree/dev#clone-the-source-code) before installation.

### For this showcase: 

Use the path:

```
> cd src/demo/cookie-inspection
```

Run install.sh with root privileges:

```
> ./install.sh
```


This is required to modify the path to the OpenCV library. If you have installed EVA on a non-ADLINK device, please check the requirements in our EVA portal.

<a id="runsh"></a>

After installation, execute run.sh for the pipeline command:

```
> ./run.sh
```




Or you can open EVA_IDE and load pygraph then execute, please see the section, [Run This Showcase Through EVA IDE](#Run-This-Showcase-Through-EVA-IDE).

Then you will see the pop-up display window of this showcase as in the example below.

## Run This Showcase Through EVA IDE(For EVASDK 3.5.2 or later)

In this showcase, you can run the pipeline by execute <a href="#runsh">run.sh</a> but also EVA IDE. Open EVA IDE and make sure your current path is in src/demo/cookie-inspection as root:

```
> EVA_ROOT/bin/EVA_IDE
```

EVA_ROOT is the path where the EVA is installed, the default installed path is /opt/adlink/eva/. So directly call EVA_IDE:

```
> /opt/adlink/eva/bin/EVA_IDE
```

And you will see the IDE show up as below:

![EVAIDE](../../../figures/EVAIDE.png)

Then select the pygraph you want to run, here for example select showcase3-onnx.pygraph in this showcase folder through File->Load. Then you can see this showcase pipeline:

![showcase3-file-load](../../../figures/showcase3-file-load.png)

![showcase3-pipeline](../../../figures/showcase3-pipeline.png)

Then press the play button ![play-button](../../../figures/play-button.png) and you will see the scenario video start to play.
